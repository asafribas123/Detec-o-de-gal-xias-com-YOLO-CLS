## Overview
Galaxy morphology is a key aspect of extragalactic astronomy.  
This repository provides the implementation, datasets, and trained models used in the paper:
> *"Deep Learning-Based Morphological Analysis of Galaxies from SDSS and DECaLS Using YOLO-CLS" (Ribas 2025)*

Our goal is to demonstrate the capability of YOLOv8-CLS for accurate, scalable, and interpretable galaxy classification.
